# CSV2Substack

This is a small python script that converts a CSV file into a Latex array that can be used in Substack to embed tabular data.

It starts with a TKinter GUI that allows you to select the CSV file, 
then it asks you some formatting questions, and then finally 
it outputs the Latex array code to the console.

There is no genius to this.
